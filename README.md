Hi! This is a _simple_ Scrabble clone made in Python that is playable through the terminal.

Or at least, that's the idea.

It will use Pygame and ScrabbleCli. It has very few lines of code yet, as this is mostly the skeleton provided in class. This README is barebones too, so keep an eye out for this project! :) [also, check the CHANGELOG].
